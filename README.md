This Python script updates the values in an INI (initialization) file. An INI file is a configuration file that stores settings and preferences for software applications. The script reads the contents of the INI file, prompts the user to input new values for specific names, and then updates the file with the new values. The updated contents are written to a new file, leaving the original INI file unchanged.
To use the script, the user simply needs to specify the paths for the input and output files in the script. The script can be run on any machine with Python installed, making it easily accessible. This script is useful for updating configuration files for software applications without having to manually edit the file. It saves time and reduces the risk of human error.
Note: The script assumes that the INI file contains name-value pairs separated by an equals sign. If the file has a different format, the script may need to be modified accordingly.
Here is a more detailed explanation of each step:

Read the contents of the INI file. The first step is to read the contents of the INI file into a variable. This can be done using the open() function in Python. The open() function takes two arguments: the path to the file and the mode in which to open the file. In this case, we will open the file in read mode, which is indicated by the "r" argument.

Split the contents by line. Once we have read the contents of the INI file, we need to split it into lines. This can be done using the split() method on the str object. The split() method takes one argument: the character to split the string on. In this case, we will split the string on newline characters, which are indicated by the "\n" argument.

Ask the user to input the new values. Now that we have the original values in the INI file, we can ask the user to input the new values. We can do this using a simple input loop. The input loop will continue to run until the user presses enter without entering any input.

Update the lines with the new values. Once the user has input the new values, we need to update the lines in the INI file with the new values. We can do this by looping through the lines and checking if the name of the line is in the dictionary of new values. If the name of the line is in the dictionary, we will update the value of the line to the value in the dictionary.

Write the updated contents to the edited file. Finally, we need to write the updated contents to the edited file. We can do this using the open() function again. This time, we will open the file in write mode, which is indicated by the "w" argument.
